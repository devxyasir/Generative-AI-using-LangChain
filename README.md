
# 📘 Generative AI Using LangChain

A collection of **practice code, experiments, and learning exercises** exploring how to build Generative AI applications using **LangChain**.
This repository documents my personal learning journey with GenAI — from basic components to more advanced workflows — all in one place.

---

## 🚀 What’s Inside

This repo includes small, modular scripts covering core LangChain concepts:

### **🔹 Models**

* Working with LLM wrappers (OpenAI, Gemini, etc.)
* Custom configurations (temperature, system prompts, output control)

### **🔹 Prompts**

* Prompt templates
* Chat prompts
* Structured outputs
* Prompt engineering experiments

### **🔹 Chains**

* LLMChain usage
* Sequential chains
* Runnable interfaces
* Multi-step reasoning flows

### **🔹 Memory**

* ConversationBufferMemory
* ConversationSummaryMemory
* Token-based memory
* Custom memory handling

### **🔹 Indexes**

* Vector stores (FAISS, Chroma)
* Embeddings
* Basic RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation)

### **🔹 Agents**

* Tools & Tool Calling
* Agent Executors
* Simple custom agents
* Practical agent workflow tests

## 🧠 Purpose of This Repository

This repository is not a production project — it’s a **sandbox** for learning.
I'm using it to:

* Practice building generative AI systems
* Improve my understanding of LangChain internals
* Explore ideas freely without worrying about polish
* Track my progression over time
* Keep all experiments organized and reproducible
